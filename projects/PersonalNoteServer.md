## Personal Note Server

## Goal
To create a simple service for me to record ideas and then be able to create mind maps via some LL, also for personal we get text messages from it reminding me
## What we will need
- Web Server 
- Simple UI for me to write down notes
- Submit button to save the Note
- Want to store notes in .MD format
- On the server it would be good to take the input, write to file, and then git push to this github

## Current State
- 12/14/2025
    - Webserver that starts but does nothing
    - HTML page that I can type in Markdown
    - TODOs
        - get server deployed on raspberry pi
        - figure out how to keep rp on all the time
        - need to add functionality for note saving
