## Personal Goals Integration

These don't need dedicated time blocks - they're mindset shifts:

| Goal | How to Address |
|------|----------------|
| Have no fear | Take one small risk weekly (ship something, share work) |
| Quality time with family | Sunday is sacred, be present at meals |
| Supportive to wife | Weekly check-in: "How can I help this week?" |
| Less self-hatred | Celebrate small wins, journal 3 gratitudes |
| Better focus | Single-task during your 1-2 hrs, phone in another room |
| More organized | 5-min weekly review every Sunday night |
| Stable income | Projects above can become income streams |

## Recommended Learning Resources

**Kernel/Systems**:
- "Writing an OS in Rust" (os.phil-opp.com)
- "Linux From Scratch" if choosing C

**Spanish**:
- Flash cards (daily practice)

**AI**:
- "Make an LLM from Scratch" (continue reading/building)

---

## Key Principles

1. **Consistency > Intensity**: 1 hour daily beats 7 hours on weekends
2. **Ship imperfect work**: Done is better than perfect
3. **Protect learning days**: Don't let projects consume all time
4. **Rest matters**: Sunday off prevents burnout
5. **Adjust as needed**: This is a guide, not a prison

## Weekly Review Questions (Sunday night, 5 min)

1. Did I make progress on card app/game?
2. Did I learn something new?
3. Did I move my body 3+ times?
4. Did I have quality family time?
5. What's my #1 priority for next week?
